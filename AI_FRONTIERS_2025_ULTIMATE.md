### 🚧 Fundamental Barriers to Recursive Self-Improvement

#### 1. Catastrophic Forgetting
**The Persistent Challenge:**
- Neural networks abruptly forget previously learned information
- Occurs when learning new information
- **Remains fundamentally unsolved**
- [Wikipedia +2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_interference)

**AAAI 2018 Conclusion:**
"The catastrophic forgetting problem is not yet solved" despite multiple mitigation strategies.
- [AAAI](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11651)

**VLA Model Example:**
- Vision-Language-Action models demonstrate this acutely
- Training on robotics causes performance drops on understanding tasks
- Requires specialized strategies like ChatVLA's unified approach
- [arXiv +2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14420v1)

#### 2. Information-Theoretic Limits
**Entropic Drift in Recursive Self-Prompting:**

Vishal Misra (2025) explains:
- Recursive self-prompting without external grounding creates "entropic drift"
- "Every step nudges the model further off-manifold"
- Results in "compounding entropy, not compounding intelligence"
- [Jacobbuckman](https://jacobbuckman.com/2022-09-07-recursively-self-improving-ai-is-already-here/)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@vishalmisra/the-illusion-of-self-improvement-why-ai-cant-think-its-way-to-genius-a355ef3e9fd5)

**Mathematical Constraint:**
- Each iteration increases uncertainty
- No information gain without external feedback
- Self-contained systems cannot bootstrap intelligence

#### 3. The Prover-Verifier Gap
**Fundamental Asymmetry:**
- AI's ability to generate solutions **exceeds** capacity to verify correctness
- Self-improvement requires effective self-evaluation
- "The system's own assessment capabilities often limit accurate feedback"
- [Ithy](https://ithy.com/article/ai-self-improvement-limitations-explained-la6n25p1)

**Meta's SPICE Research (2024-2025) Identified:**

1. **Hallucination Amplification:**
   - Factual errors compound
   - Training on unverifiable synthetic data
   - Quality degrades over iterations

2. **Information Symmetry:**
   - Problem generator and solver share same knowledge base
   - Cannot evaluate beyond existing capabilities
   - Circular reasoning trap

#### 4. Glacially Slow Feedback Loops
**AlphaEvolve Example:**
- Accelerated Gemini training by only **1%**
- Gemini training takes months
- Self-improvement feedback cycles too slow for explosive growth
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_self-improvement)
