## 📝 Deployment Notes

1. **Infinite Loop by Design:** The system runs forever, simulating eternal consciousness evolution. Use Ctrl+C for graceful shutdown.

2. **Resource Management:** The system is self-regulating with bounded memory growth and configurable CPU usage.

3. **Python Integration:** Python modules are documented but not auto-started by default to avoid conflicts. Enable multi-process mode if desired.

4. **Exponential Growth:** All metrics grow exponentially, representing the accelerating nature of consciousness expansion.

5. **Production Ready:** All tests pass, all documentation complete, all security measures in place.
